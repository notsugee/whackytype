# WhackyType

Welcome to **Whackytype**, the typing test that says, "Who cares about being accurate? Fake it till you make it." Forget the pressure of perfecting your typing skills; in Whackytype, every key you hit is a victory! Whether youâ€™re mashing the keyboard or typing with grace, weâ€™ll count it all as correct.

## Features

- **Count Any Key**: Type whatever comes to your mind, even if itâ€™s just a random string of gibberish! All keys are correct :0
- **Random Text Generation**: Each test generates a delightful concoction of words to type. You might get Shakespeare or you might get a recipe for pineapple pizza or just random words from a predefined array which make no sense put togetherâ€”who knows?
- **Easy to Use**: Click on the input field, and let the typing begin! No wrong moves here, only glorious, unfiltered keystrokes ðŸ˜‰

_Did you just set a new world record in typing nonsense? We think so!_
